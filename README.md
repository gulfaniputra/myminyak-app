## About

A simple gasoline price tracker web application for Balikpapan City.

It tracks Pertalite to Pertamax from Pertamina, Shell, BP, & Vivo.

The name 'myminyak' derives from the combination of the English word _my_ & the
Indonesian word _minyak_ ('oil').

## Description

The primary objective is to learn TypeScript, Node.js, & Express.js by
implementing professional-grade back-end web application development
methodologies & toolings:

- Linting
- Code formatting
- Test-driven development
- Database integration
- Build & deployment
- CI/CD
- `// In progress...`

In this project, I picked TypeScript & Express.js due to these reasons:

- TypeScript is an industry standard for building modern applications with major
  libraries/frameworks (_e.g._ React & Angular).
- Express.js is a great back-end framework for novice like me to explore core
  concepts of server-side development (_e.g._ routing, middleware, &
  request/response cycles).

The secondary objective is to create a web application that visualize one of the
top issues in Balikpapan City: high gasoline prices.
